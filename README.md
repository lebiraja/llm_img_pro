# 🧠📷 LLM Image Pro

**LLM Image Pro** is an intelligent image reasoning system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). This project is designed to interpret and analyze visual content through natural language capabilities, offering smart insights from images in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Image input and intelligent analysis
- 🤖 Natural language reasoning over visual data
- 📦 Easy to extend with different LLMs (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)
- 🛠 Lightweight and modular design for fast prototyping

---

## 🧪 Requirements

Make sure to install the necessary Python packages before running the project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

> If `requirements.txt` is not present, make sure to install:
>
> * `openai` (or your preferred LLM client)
> * `PIL` / `opencv-python`
> * `requests`
> * `streamlit` (if it uses a UI)

## 📂 Project Structure

```
llm_img_pro/
├── main.py             # Core script that loads and processes images using LLMs
├── assets/             # Store sample/test images (optional)
├── README.md           # You're here!
└── requirements.txt    # Dependencies list (recommended)
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User inputs an image
2. The image is processed (base64 encoded or saved)
3. The LLM receives the image with a query or prompt
4. The LLM returns natural language reasoning or insights

> **Use cases:** Visual Q\&A, context extraction, image captioning, or domain-specific image reasoning.

---

## 🛠 Usage

Run the script using:

```bash
python main.py
```

If you’re using a UI (like Streamlit):

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## 📈 Future Improvements

* [ ] Add support for multi-image comparison
* [ ] Improve prompt engineering for various tasks
* [ ] ONNX/ML inference fallback without LLMs
* [ ] Web integration / Telegram bot

Would you like me to create a matching `requirements.txt` for your script as well? And if you'd like to add a project logo or cover image, I can design one too!
