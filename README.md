# 🧠📷 LLM Image Pro

**LLM Image Pro** is an intelligent image reasoning system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). This project is designed to interpret and analyze visual content through natural language capabilities, offering smart insights from images in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔍 Accepts image input for deep analysis
* 🤖 Natural language reasoning from LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA)
* 📦 Extensible support for different LLMs (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)
* 🛠️ Lightweight modular design for rapid prototyping and integration

## 🧪 Requirements

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually:

```bash
pip install openai pillow opencv-python requests streamlit
```

## 📂 Project Structure

```
llm_img_pro/
├── main.py             # Core script for image input and LLM reasoning
├── assets/             # Sample/test images (optional)
├── README.md           # You're here!
└── requirements.txt    # Project dependencies
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads or inputs an image.
2. Image is encoded or saved temporarily.
3. The LLM is prompted with an image and query.
4. Response from the LLM gives reasoning, caption, or answer.

> **Use Cases:** Visual question answering, image captioning, scene description, domain-specific reasoning, etc.

## 🛠️ Usage

### CLI/Script

```bash
python main.py
```

### Streamlit UI (if integrated)

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## 📊 Future Improvements

* [ ] Add multi-image comparison
* [ ] Improve prompts for various vision tasks
* [ ] Add fallback for ONNX/ML-only inference (no LLM)
* [ ] Integrate with web/Telegram for accessibility
